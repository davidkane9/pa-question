The purpose of this document is to answer a question about the pa package. See the other files in the repo for the orignal file and the associated data.

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(pa)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)
```


```{r}
#| message: false

# The raw file is a bit of a mess. Ignore that for now.

x <- read_excel("Sample.xlsx", skip = 1) |> 
  clean_names()
```

Data is a bit of a mess.

```{r}
summary(x)
```

But, an appropriate call to `brinson()` should work now.
